<p>This is my system for managing time. I use consistent calendar event names to assign times for tasks and track time assignment with a spreadsheet. To expedite this process, I use a script to interface between my calendar and spreadsheet. In theory, this can be used to compliment any task management system but I will present the skeleton of mine here.</p>

<p>The basic premise is that a script populates a spreadsheet with the number of hours you have assigned to different categories of tasks.</p>

<p>I believe that this will be particularly helpful for those - such as myself - that are absent-minded and often forget about their more trivial (but often important) tasks/duties. I have found that if I want to ensure the completion of a task/duty, it is important that I assign time for it. </p>

<p>Additionally, planning with all tasks/duties in mind ensures that I have enough time to complete everything I intend to. Later in the week, when I need to reschedule events, I can do so knowing how tasks and duties are generally distributed throughout the week.</p>

<p>At first, the calendar may seem daunting. While set up can be a bit time-consuming, maintanence takes approximately 1 hr per week and adjustments are quick and painless.</p>

<h4 id="set-up">Set up</h4>

<h5 id="what-do-you-need">What do you need?</h5>

<p>This system has two essential pieces: a calendar and a spreadsheet.</p>

<table>

    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>For the calendar and spreadsheet applications, I recommend using Google’s (<a href="https://www.google.com/calendar/about/">Google Calendar</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/sheets/about/">Google Sheets</a>) because you can interface with them via <a href="https://developers.google.com/apps-script/?hl=en">Apps Scripts</a>. (App Scripts are JavaScript scripts which can access information in your google applications). Additionally, Google Calendar is stored online and is thus accessible from any platform. To organize your tasks, you will need something to list them – paper should be fine. </p>

<p>In order to track my time delegation to tasks in different categories, I <br />
(1) create sub-calendars based on super-categories and <br />
(2) implant sub-category membership information into event names. <br />
For example, I delegate time for research using my “Work” sub-calendar. Labels for time working on my project modeling a DIRC particle detector always contained “dirc”. (This consistent naming is especially important in having an App Script automatically populate a spreadsheet with your time delegation).</p>

<p>Below, I describe the super-categories and sub-categories I use.</p>

<h5 id="super-categoriessub-calendars">Super-Categories/Sub-Calendars</h5>

<p>I create super-categories based on the type of tasks/duties I expect to have. For example, I know that I will have some responsibilities which will require a consistent block of time every week so I have a “Fixed” super-category; I know that outside of my schoolwork and research, I enjoy pursuing side-projects so I have a “Personal” super-category. </p>

<p>You can find a full list of my current super-categories below. Please do not restrict yourself to these. Take a moment to reflect and create super-categories which you feel describe how you delienate your tasks. While you can always update them in the future, a list which accurately reflects your task delienation will ease task delegation. </p>

    </tr>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Personal</td>
      <td>time for tasks that are useful/interesting but not essential or required</td>
      <td>- learn new programming principles <br /> - personal projects</td>
    </tr>

      <td>this holds things that I don’t know where else to put.</td>
      <td>- breaks <br /> - going to the gym</td>
    </tr>

</table>

<p>(In theory, you can place all of your events into one sub-calendar, but with many calendars, your events will be color coordinated, which is very useful for quickly parsing them.)</p>

<hr />
<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="sub-categories">Sub-Categories</h5>

<p>Your sub-category labels will correspond to your current tasks/duties, but the level of categorization to which they correspond can vary. For example, if you are completing graduate school and fellowship applications, you can have <br />
(1) <strong>broad</strong>: “applications” <br />
(2) <strong>more specific</strong>: “grad” and “fellowship”<br />
(3) <strong>even more specific</strong>: “columbia”, “carnegie”, “fulbright”.<br />
It is really a matter of preference. I use a combination of different levels. </p>

<p>For whatever level you choose, consider opting for shorter labels since you will have to write this label in the event title of every event that corresponds to this sub-category.</p>

<p>Your sub-category choices are more amenable than your super-category choices. While your super-category choices may remain for months, you may add/remove sub-categories on a weekly basis. </p>

<p>Below are sub-categories I am currently using.</p>

<h5 id="setting-up-your-spreadsheet">Setting Up Your Spreadsheet</h5>

<p>This is fairly straightforward. You can download this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ELRQ8M8bjhPlvydnJxGaMsTuwaKN6YKjQJLUZ3zmKFs/pub?output=xlsx">excel file</a> which contains the spreadsheet setup.</p>

<p><img class="regular materialboxed responsive-img" src="/files/time_management/spreadsheet_layout.png" /></p>

<p>Once you have downloaded the file, you can <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/">upload it</a> into Google Sheets.</p>

<p>Download <a href="/files/time_management/time_tracker.js">this script</a> (right-click and select “Save Link As”).</p>

<p>In your google sheet, select</p>

<pre><code>    Tools -&gt; Script Editor...
</code></pre>

<p>Replace the contents of the script that opens with the contents of the script in the file above. Save and the features are ready to use.</p>

<p>Place your super-categories vertically starting at B8 and your sub-categories horizantally starting at B2.</p>

<p>To the left of your super-categories, you can put the color you intend for the row. This field accepts written colors and hexadecimal colors.</p>

<p>The time for sub-categories is only populated using sub-calendars that have text written in their corresponding color cell. Writing a color for the sub-calendar’s row satisfies this requirement. You can think of these super-categories as being “active”.</p>

<p><img class="regular materialboxed responsive-img" src="/files/time_management/spreadsheet_initial_fill.png" /></p>

<p>In the above example, time delegation for sub-categories “570,” “561,” “ml,” and “apps” would only be tracked using sub-calendars “Work,” “Assignable,” and “Personal.”</p>

<p>Now that you’ve filled in the spreadsheet, I will quickly cover how to use the script. Your spreadsheet should now have a “Time Tracker” menu. Below I describe each option.</p>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Fill Super Category Times</td>
      <td>Fill in C8 onwards with the time assigned to their corresponding sub-calendars</td>
    </tr>

      <td>Fill Colors</td>
      <td>Color in the sub-calendar rows according to the colors written in A8 onwards</td>

<h5 id="setting-up-your-calendar-base">Setting Up Your Calendar Base</h5>

<p>In theory, each week has 168 hours to delegate. In practice, you won’t fill every single hour, but the idea is to fill most.</p>

<p><strong>Fixed events</strong><br />
Start by creating events for all of your fixed responsibilities. (You may not have any). I place time for my classes here since their starting time and duration are fairly consistent across weeks.</p>

<p><img class="regular materialboxed responsive-img" src="/files/time_management/calendar_fixed_intitial.png" /></p>

<p><strong>Daily activities</strong><br />
Now, there are certain activities that you must do every day such as going to sleep, eating breakfast, eating dinner, etc. Place times for all of these events. Be sure to do this for your weekends as well. I place them in my “Misc.” sub-calendar. </p>

<p><img class="regular materialboxed responsive-img" src="/files/time_management/calendar_with_initial_plans.png" /></p>

<ul class="collapsible" data-collapsible="accordian">
  <li>
    <div class="header collapsible-header center"> A note on sleep </div>
    <div class="body collapsible-body">
      <p> I personally only need 7+ hours of sleep to be productive and diligent throughout the day, yet I still assign 8 hours of sleep. I have been using a Fit Bit for some time now and have found that for however long I am in bed, I typically get apx. an hour less of sleep. <br /> <br />
      I tracked my productivity on days where I slept under and over 7 hours, and found that at least 7 hours was necessary to ensure that I was efficient, effective, and attentive while working. With less, I had trouble following discussions or derivations in class, I was more forgetful - I was generally a less capable learner and doer.
      </p>
    </div>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Do not worry too much about placing the events at optimal times. As you continue filling in your calendar, you will optimize event arrangement.</p>

<p>As you create the template for your schedule, it is important that you are honest with yourself about your habits and tendencies. This will help to ensure that you follow the schedule you create.</p>

<ul class="collapsible" data-collapsible="accordian">
  <li>
    <div class="header collapsible-header center"> 
    A note on being honest with yourself
    </div>
    <div class="body collapsible-body">
      <p> 
      While your calendar should be true to your tendencies and habits, it can also be useful in changing them. The key to this, in my opinion, is that the change is implemented slowly. You do not want to create a schedule with activities that wildly diverge from your current activities.
      <br /><br />
      For example, throughout the week, I begin my morning routine at about 7am and proceed to begin working by 8 or 9am. I would love to continue this into my weekend but that is not realistic. I know that I enjoy staying up late on weekends and waking up at about 10am. With this in mind, I plan to sleep until 10 and begin my day at about 11am. I intentionally put an hour cushion because I recognize that I often end up sleeping until 11am.
      <br /><br />
      I don't mind this but if I wanted to change this habit, rather than planning to wake up at 7am, I would plan to wake up at 9 or 9:30am. Once I became accustomed to that, I would change it to again and repeat.
      </p>
    </div>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I should note that I put a 10-minute cushion between most events. This is often just for travel time but it also helps me keep my schedule when events run a little over. This has other benefits I’ll discuss later on.</p>

<p><strong>Initial base fill</strong><br />
This next part is a bit tricky. We want to create assignable time blocks. This means that they have to be fairly general. </p>

<p>I try to create time blocks that are under 3 hrs and within 10 minutes of the closest 30-minute mark, e.g 20 minutes, 50 minutes, 1 hour, 20 minutes, etc. Time blocks of this length allow for the 10 minute cushion between events I mentioned before. </p>

<p>To begin, I fill my calendar with time blocks of the length mentioned above periodically seperated by 20 minute breaks as follows. </p>

<p><img class="regular materialboxed responsive-img" src="/files/time_management/calendar_initial_fill.png" /></p>

<p>This is by no means the final base. We now have an idea of how much time we have to distribute across different sub-categories of tasks/duties/responsibilities.</p>

<p><strong>Redistributing time into super-categories</strong><br />
Using the spreadsheet, we can calculate the number of hours assigned to each sub-calendar for a designated period of time.</p>

<p><img class="regular materialboxed responsive-img" src="/files/time_management/spreadsheet_initial_calculation.png" /></p>

<p>51.75 hours to delegate.</p>

<p>I assume that you do not want to dedicate all 51.75 of these hours to your official work. Maybe you play the saxaphone and would like to dedicate 6 hours a week to that, maybe you have a side business that requires 7 hours a week. </p>

<p>This is where my “Personal” and “Extra” calendars come in. I dedicate ~7 hours to work in my “Personal” calendar and ~2.5 hours to work in my “Extra” calendar.</p>

<p>I have noticed that I typically have one errand that requires that I travel somewhere per week (e.g. post office, dmv, car wash, etc.). By dedicating one time block to errands, I force myself to make time for them.</p>

<ul class="collapsible" data-collapsible="accordian">
  <li>
    <div class="header collapsible-header center"> 
    Logic to my distribution
    </div>
    <div class="body collapsible-body">
      <p> 
      <b>Work + Breaks:</b> I have found that I can work for up to 3 hours (with short breaks) before I need a longer break. Depending on how mentally straining my work is, the length of this break can vary. By having 20 minute breaks with 10-minute cushions on both sides, I can extend my break to 40 minutes when needed. <br /><br />
      <b>Personal:</b> Saturday seemed like an optimal choice for "unofficial work." I needed about ~2 hours in addition to the time delegated to saturday. Because I tend to thoroughly enjoy this work, I decided to place my last assignment towards the end of the day. I chose monday arbitrarily. <br /><br />
      <b>Extra:</b> On Wednesday, I saw that I potentially would be working for 3.5+ hours. I find that I become ineffective if I work this long, so I decided to dedicate that last hour to "extra" work. On Friday, I saw that I had a work block for an hour before one of my classes. I know that I cannot get "in the zone" in this amount of time, so i dedicated this hour to "extra" work. <br /><br />
      <b>Errands:</b> I saw that I had a sole work block on Friday between classes. I decided to dedicate it to errands. Because the following block is an extra block, a potentially long errand (e.g. 4+ hours at the dmv) could be accomodated here without a loss of work time. I buy groceries on weekly basis and do laundry on a bi-weekly basis. The former takes about 1.5 hours and the latter about 2 hours. I saw that I had free after my last class on Friday so I put time for groceries then. Since I have less motivation to do work as the day progresses, I decided to assign time for laundry towards the end of the day and picked Thursday arbitrarily. <br /><br />
      
      <b>Other factors:</b><br />
      1. My grandmother and mother like to speak with me weekly so I put time in my calendar to call them.<br />
      2. I like to spend some time every night just relaxing, so I allocated 1 hour every night to this with an event called "Nada".<br />
      3. I leave my bag at the gym in the morning. If I don't assign time to pick it up, I usually forget to. So towards the end of days I go to the gym, I have time assigned to pick up my bag.<br />
      4. I know that after a class, I cannot go straight back to work, so I assign breaks to follow so that my mind can recharge.<br />
    
      </p>
    </div>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Remember to make your events repeat weekly. I recommend that each event repeats once weekly rather than multiple times per week. In the future, if you decide to make changes to your schedule, events that repeat once weekly will be easier to deal with than events that repeat multiple times per week.</p>

<h4 id="time-assignment">Time Assignment</h4>

<p>This part is a bit more personal.</p>

<p>My semester begins on 1/11/2016; however, I like to begin following my schedule one week in advance. I will use this week (1/2/2016 - 1/9/2016) to demonstrate filling in your calendar. As I fill in my calendar, I will try to describe the logic that I use. </p>

<ul class="collapsible" data-collapsible="accordian">
  <li>
    <div class="header collapsible-header center"> 
    Why I start my week on Saturday
    </div>
    <div class="body collapsible-body">
      <p>
      You will notice that 1/2/2016 is a Saturday. I like to plan my week out on Friday with Saturday as my starting day. By doing so, I can see how much time I need to spend that weekend in order to accomplish my goals. This also shows me how much free time I have that weekend.
      <br /><br />
      Depending on my deadlines, I will sometimes plan up to 9 days in advance (Saturday until the next Sunday), making changes to my weekend plans the following Friday depending on the progress I've made that week.    
      </p>
    </div>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to your calendar and spreadsheet, I recommend you assign your time from a task list. I list all of mine on a sheet of looseleaf.</p>

<p>You’ll see that I make a mini-column for every category of tasks I need to complete. I approximate the amount of time I’ll need for each task and sum this time for each category.</p>

<p>If you having trouble with this, you may find this <a href="https://hackmake.org/reference/gtd-trigger-list">trigger list</a> helpful. If some items in the list are especially helpful, I recommend you write them down for future reference.</p>

<p>If you’re unsure about how much time to give a task, a common rule-of-thumb is to make an estimate and multiply it by 3. As you continue to track your time, your predictions will become more accurate.</p>

<p>Here is my starting setup.</p>

<table>
<tr>
    <td>
      <img class="regular materialboxed responsive-img" src="/files/time_management/ex_calendar_starting.png" />
    </td>
    <td>
      <img class="regular materialboxed responsive-img" src="/files/time_management/ex_spreadsheet_starting.png" />
    </td>
    <td>
      <img class="regular materialboxed responsive-img" src="/files/time_management/ex_tasks_starting.png" />
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>You will have to put the start date and end date for which you’ll be tracking your time across cells E7-H7 and E8-H8, respectively.</p>

<p>If you don’t put a start date, the spreadsheet will begin tracking time from the current time. If you don’t put an end date, the spreadsheet will track until midnight of the following Saturday.</p>

<h5 id="filling-your-calendar-and-spreadsheet">Filling your calendar and spreadsheet</h5>

<p>“Filling” your calendar is simply renaming event titles according to their corresponding task.</p>

<p><strong>First assignment</strong><br />
The first thing that I fill are the appointments errands that I feel that I must complete that week. Since school has not started yet, I’ve decided to try to complete numerous errands this week.</p>

<table>
<tr>
    <td>
      <img class="regular materialboxed responsive-img" src="/files/time_management/ex_calendar_errands.png" />
    </td>
    <td>
      <img class="regular materialboxed responsive-img" src="/files/time_management/ex_spreadsheet_errands.png" />
    </td>
    <td>
      <img class="regular materialboxed responsive-img" src="/files/time_management/ex_tasks_errands.png" />
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>To help keep track of how many hours I have left, I make a cell calculate the difference between the sum of delegated times (time for active super-categories) and the sum of assigned times (time for sub-categories).</p>

<p>Since I won’t go to the gym on either tuesday or thursday, I thought those were optimal days to do errands that involved my car (getting car detailed and DMV). Had I chosen these errands for days I go to the gym, I would lose time to commuting between the gym and my house.</p>

<p>Following this logic, chase and the post office are errands that require my car, so placing them after another car errand seemed optimal. </p>

<p>When I go to the gym, I typically stay on campus, so I scheduled my last errand that involved going to an adminstration building after the gym.</p>

<p><strong>Second assignment</strong><br /></p>

<p>On monday, I am meeting with a postdoc in my lab. I intend to ask him to collaborate with me on a project.</p>

<p>I think the conversation will go over more smoothly if I prepare in writing what parts of my project I think he might be interested in. </p>

<p>Sanjay also has a project which I might collaborate with him on. Because I suspect that we will likely discuss theoretical and technical aspects of our projects, I thought it best to delegate many of my research tasks before I met him. By doing so, I hope to be better-equipped for our conversation. </p>

<p>I like to dedicate long sequences of blocks to lengthy tasks. I find that it takes me about an hour to “get in the zone.” Afterwards, I work more efficiently and effectively on the current task as my thoughts begin to revolve around it.</p>

<p>I saw a long stretch of time-blocks on Wednesday. I thought this would be optimal for a long coding task I have for my research.</p>

<p>You’ll notice that I predicted 14 hours to research but assigned 21. This is fine. As I continue assigning time, if I feel I need more time for other tasks, I can always readjust my time assignments. With my spreadhseet, I can easily track how much each category is over and under.</p>

<p><strong>“Final” assignment</strong><br /></p>

<p>You’ll notice that I re-arranged many time-blocks. This is one of the benefits of this system: quick re-adjustment.</p>

<p>I needed about 4 hours for looking into sorting algorithms so I put that immediately after the gym on Wednesday. Afterwards I placed a break and some simple tasks to rest my brain. I assigned the rest of the day to going over proofs.</p>

<p>I like to divide tasks that give me difficulty accross multiple days. I find that when I re-continue the task, it is far easier for me. With this in mind, I seperated my time working on proofs across Wednesday night and Friday morning.</p>

<p>I left the end of my day on Friday to work on general 570 tasks.</p>

<h5 id="adjustments">Adjustments</h5>

<p>One of the reasons that I start following my schedule a week early is that I tend to not follow my schedule that well the first week. If you experience similarly your first week, don’t worry, as weeks pass by, I better follow my schedule and you probably will too.</p>

<p><strong>Sunday</strong><br /></p>

<p><img class="regular materialboxed responsive-img" src="/files/time_management/ex_calendar_adjusted_1.png" /></p>

<p>On Sunday, I realized that I needed to set time for the following:<br />
1. Buying a few groceries - 10 min (1 time)  <br />
2. Cleaning my room - 30 min (1 time) <br />
3. Cooking Dinner - 30 min (x2 weekly) <br />
4. Eating Dinner - 30 min (~daily)</p>

<p>(DUH to that last 2!)</p>

<p>I decided to set times to cook on Sunday and Wednesday, making dinner that would last about 3 days (inclusive). I set 20 minutes after dinner for eating it on Sunday and Wednesday. For the other days, I set 20 minutes for dinner followed by a break incase I wanted to lounge around for a bit before getting back to work.</p>

<p>I woke up fairly late so I shifted my task summarizing ANNs to a later time and removed my task doing a tutorial. I gave that task more time than planned originally, so this was fine. </p>

<p><strong>Monday</strong><br /></p>

<p><img class="regular materialboxed responsive-img" src="/files/time_management/ex_calendar_adjusted_2.png" /></p>

<p>On monday, my meeting with Sanjay went longer than I expected. I accounted for this in my calendar and found that I didn’t have enough time for my “Personal” task. It wasn’t urgent so I moved it the following Weekend to be rescheduled that Friday. </p>

<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>

<p>I hope this has given you a general sense of how to set up your calendar, fill your calendar, and adjust your calendar. </p>
