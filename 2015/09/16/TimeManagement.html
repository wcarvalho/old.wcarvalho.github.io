<p>Once you have cloned the master directory from git, you can begin the process of building this library via
<code>
cd dircobjects
autoreconf --force --install
</code>
You can configure with <code>./configure</code>. You can set the prefix as you normally would for a library installed with pkg-config. This simply requires that you set your prefix to a prefix recognized by pkg-config. One can do so as follows
<code>
./configure --prefix=$PKG_CONFIG_PATH
</code>
You can then build and install via
<code>
make
make install
</code>
To force a fresh release after an earlier checkout do
<code>
make distclean
git pull
./configure
make
make install
</code></p>
