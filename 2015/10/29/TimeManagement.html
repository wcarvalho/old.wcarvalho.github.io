<h5 id="what-will-you-need">What will you need? </h5>
<ol>
  <li>A Calendar Application. I recommend that you use <a href="https://www.google.com/calendar/about/">Google Calendar</a>. It has a few benefits:
    <ol>
      <li>The calendar is stored online and accessible from any platform via an application or (at worst) your web browser. I use the default calendar apps on my MacBook and Android phone to do so .</li>
      <li>Google has made it very easy to write JavaScript scripts to interface with Google Calendar via <a href="https://developers.google.com/apps-script/?hl=en">Apps Scripts</a>. I have written one for this system, which I have shared here.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Something to write your list of tasks on. I use <a href="https://www.onenote.com/">OneNote</a>. You can also use a text editor or a piece of loose-leaf – anything that you can use to write and cross off tasks.</li>
</ol>

<h5 id="what-else-might-be-helpful">What else might be helpful?</h5>
<ol>
  <li>A spreadsheet or something equivalent. I use <a href="https://www.google.com/sheets/about/">Google Sheets</a> because I can interface with it via App Scripts. This will be helpful in tracking how many hours are available for different (a) sub-calendars (more on this later) and (b) different task categories.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is helpful to track how many hours you’ve assigned to different categories of tasks. For those that use google calendar, the script I am attaching automatically tracks this time for you and puts it in a spread sheet. This saves me a lot of time.
2. Task Manager. I like to use ToDoist to keep track of all of my upcoming tasks. It has some features which allow me to quickly bring up many of the upcoming tasks. I will soon write and link a small post on the beneficial features of ToDoist and how I use it.
 
The key to my system is having a predefined, consistent structure. It relies on pre-defined events that I call blocks which I fill in at the beginning of every week. It is similar to the schedules we received when we were in high school except that the events from day to day are variable. The similarity is in the consistency of the events and their lengths. 
 
I am currently a graduate student, so this post will be catered towards students but I’m sure that it can be modified to fit many needs. I plan to continue using this system for the rest of my life. I will begin by detailing how to create this this system. 
 
Now let’s create a base system. Set up tasks some time but up keep is a breeze!
Note: for all of the calendar names, you can use another name you find more appropriate. You can adjust anything to your preferences but I highly recommend copying this system verbatim and then changing it over time as you see things that would work better for you. 
 
Setting up Calendars
1. First create a calendar called “fixed times”. In this calendar put anything that is consistent every single week. For me, that’s just my classes. It looks as follows
  <img />
   
2. Now, create the following calendars, “blocks”, and “planning”, “errands”, and “computer work.” You want to account for all of the things that might take up your time, otherwise you (like I did for a long time) may live life thinking you have more time to do things than you actually do.
  · Blocks: calendar in which all of the work that you are responsible for will go into. For me, this is where I place school work and research
  · Planning: calendar where I place things that help me plan my time. For example, I place time for my morning and night routines in this block, time to shower, time for work breaks, etc. I will come back to what my morning and night routines are and their utility. 
  · Errands: calendar where I place my errands like doing my laundry or going grocery shopping.
  · Computer work: calendar where you do small tasks on your computer like checking email, organizing files, etc. Once I began tracking tasks like this I was surprised by how many there were and how much time they consumed. I realized that if I didn’t allocate time for them, they would never get done. Recent examples for me include: (1) moving my files from OneDrive to Drop Box (2) reinstalling Microsoft office (3) setting up my kindle to accept PDFs. 
  Now, if you have your own projects that you want to work on, then create a fourth calendar, “personal”. My fourth calendar is called “career work” because it is when I do things that are not relevant to my school work or research but still useful for my future career. I think “personal” is fine though. 
 
Filling out your calendar
  I suggest you begin filling out your calendar by putting in 8-hour sleep blocks for every day and then times for you to shower, eat breakfast, and get ready in the morning. For me these things are included in my morning ritual to which I allocate 50 minutes (more on why later). Don’t worry if you’re worried about planning out your sleep on weekends, the beauty of this calendar is that its fairly flexible. For now, just approximate.
    DROPDOWN: Note on sleep: 
    I personally only need 7+ hours of sleep to be productive and diligent throughout the day– yet, I still assign 8hours of sleep. Why? I have been using a Fit Bit for the past 3 months and have found that while I may go to bed at 12 and wake at 7, I only get about 6.5 hours of sleep. To get 7+, I need to be in bed for about 8 hours. I tracked my productivity on days where I slept under and over 7 hours, and found that 7 hours was necessary to ensure that I was efficient, effective, and attentive while working. With less, I would have trouble following discussions or derivations in class, I was more forgetful - generally a less capable learner and doer.
   
  Now using the Planning calendar, place in time for things you do every day like eating breakfast, going to the gym etc. Below is what my mornings now look like. 
  <img />
    DROPDOWN: One <em>key</em> thing to this system’s success: <em>be honest with yourself</em>. 
    I would love to plan out super productive weekends where I wake up at 8 am, go through my morning routine and begin working. That would be overly optimistic (for me). Now, if you can and want to do this, please, feel free. I can’t so I have my sleep ending at 9 am on weekends, and morning ritual beginning at 10 with an hour of cushion in case I want to sleep until 10 (which I often but not always do). Please don’t plan your calendar with overly optimistic blocks. Now, if you want to change your habits, that’s fine. Change your habits one at a time. Let’s say you wake up at 12 every Saturday but would like to wake up earlier. Slowly adjust your time (I recommend 1 hour every 3 weeks) until you’re at your desired time. 
  I should note that I put a 10-minute cushion between every single event. This is often just for travel time but it also helps me keep my calendar when events run a little over. It has other benefits I’ll discuss later on. 
   
  This next part is tricky. We want to create events with consistent timing for blocks and personal (if you have it) such that you have sufficient time in blocks to assign to your required work and still have time left over for whatever else you want to do (personal projects, relax, whatever). 
   
1. Now I don’t know about your program but in mine, classes are either 50 minutes, 1 hour 20 minutes, or 1 hour 50 minutes. To align with that, I make all of my blocks one of those lengths. 
  I kept the following in mind when I created my blocks:
· I want to have time every day to go over my flash cards so I left 4-4:50 open every M/W/F.
· I wanted to set aside time to do small tasks on my computer like check my email or organize files on my computer, so I left 4-4:50 open every T/TH.
· I need time every week to run errands like groceries and laundry.
· I am a member of a dance club on campus so I put those times in my calendar.
· My grandmother and mother like to speak with me weekly so I put time in my calendar to call them. 
· I like to spend some time every night just relaxing, so I allocated 1/2 hour every night to this with an event called “Nada”.
· I would like to practice for the GRE so I set time aside every Tuesday and Wednesday. 
  With those things in mind, I got the following
  <img />
  You’ll notice I have events called “Pick up gym bag”. I go to the gym in the morning, leave my bag, and pick it up at night. I allocate time for this. This may seem tedious but if you don’t allocate time for these small things like checking email, doing flash cards, studying for the GRE, picking up your bag from the gym, they will either never get done or they will eat up time you’ve allocated for other tasks, disallowing you from accomplishing what you’d originally planned. 
 
  TIPS on creating blocks
  I like to have 2-3 hours of sequences of blocks followed by a 20-minute break. Each block has a 10-minute cushion so if needed the 20-minute break can be turned into a 40-minute break while preserving your work blocks.
  I recognize that lectures and social events are particularly draining for me so I always schedule a break after one of these events. 
  You can find my personal setup below
   
  <img /> 
   
  DROPDOWN: Some tips based on my own heuristics: back to being honest with yourself– I know that after a class, I cannot go straight to work, so I assign a break afterwards where my mind can recharge. I know that I get tired around 3:30 so I set up a break before and after my flash cards and computer tasks blocks. This work is not mentally straining and coupled with my breaks before and after, it allows me to continue working through the rest of the day. 
   
  You’ll notice I have a block called “go somewhere tasks”. This is a block I leave empty every week for errands that require that I go somewhere. This week is going to my financial aid. Last week it was going to the bank. For me, if I don’t have predefined times for things like this, they never get done. 
   
OKAY! Now the base is complete. 
Make sure that all of your events repeat per week. This way when you make a change to timing, future events will reflect this change. This also makes it easy to fill out your calendar weekly.
 
This calendar is flexible because its assignable. For example, this week I have a meeting with a professor I’m doing research with. To have extra preparation time for this meeting, I’m dedicating some of the blocks I normally dedicated to Personal work to research work. 
 
With the base complete, the next step is just to change the name of all of those general calendar events like “block” or “computer work” to actual tasks. Now this isn’t required but I personally find that if I plan out what tasks I will do at what times before hand, that I spend less time debating which task is optimal at the moment. The benefit of planning ahead of time is that you’ve spent time looking over all of your tasks so the list of your tasks and their relative importance is fresh in your mind. When you plan in the moment (at least I) tend to forget these things and either pick suboptimal tasks or spend too much time deciding.
 
This is my process. I complete it every Friday for the following week.
I like Friday because I can then plan out the amount of work that needs to be done in the weekend in order to successfully finish my work the following week. It also gives me a chance to see how much spare time I have that weekend to hang out or work on personal projects.
 
Process: 
Write down all of your tasks by category on a piece of paper. I have 3 classes and research so I divide my paper into 4 columns plus a fifth for personal and computer tasks. In each column, put the tasks of each category that are either due or that you would like to accomplish along with their estimated time of completion. If you are having trouble estimating this, rule of thumb is to make a guess and multiply by 2 or 3. Don’t worry, as you continue to estimate the length of time tasks take, you will improve at predicting this. Below is my sheet:
 
<img />
Notice how I didn’t always write full names or sentences, I just needed an identifier for the task. Remember, this isn’t your task list for the week, it’s only meant to be transcribed onto the calendar.
 
While I fill out my calendar, I have an accompanying spreadsheet which holds the amount of time for every category
<img />
(remember than my “career” is your “personal”).
In a future post that I will link or use to supplement this section, I will detail how to use one of my JavaScript scripts to automate this counting process for you. (One of the many perks to programming: Automation!)
 
Assigning tasks
· want to dedicate long sequences of blocks to long time
· over time you’ll get more in the zone and work more quickly on that task
· assigned part of the task one night and the next morning is a good idea (your brain will process information related to that task as you sleep)
· I personally used flash cards and computer task a divider between long sets of tasks
· before one I may have many hours dedicated to working on a project while after, I’ll have many hours dedicated to something else
 
Remember– as I assign each task, I cross it off my list. I usually begin by first assigning tasks with urgent deadlines or tasks that I need to catch up on from the previous week.
· Week 8 and Lectures 14&amp;15 were from the previous week so I assigned them to Saturday.
· I have class for 455 on Tuesday so I want to have the reading for the week completed before class, so I assign that early on.
· I need extra time to work on my paper before I see my professor so I assigned my longer blocks of “career work” to this and left the 2, smaller, remaining blocks to working on this website.
· My project for 571 is finished but I need one final touch and to test it. I assign ~2 hours to this.
After putting down some of the most urgent things, I had the following:
<img />
Note: I have weekend tasks set to a certain time every week so it is already filled. I sometimes assign more time if I have more to go over or prepare one week (perhaps if I’m traveling soon).
 
Now I have a few tasks left, does the order matter? Yes, I want to complete the lectures for 571 before class as well.
There are videos shown in class I go over after class. I assign those to the data after each class. 
I have assigned time on Sunday to read for my 455 class. I would like to continue working on 455 work for the next block since there’s only one final block, so I assign that time to my 455 hw. 
I have labs on Thursday which I can complete more quickly on my own so I usually do them the night before. I assign a long block the night before Thursday to my 455 lab.
I like to go over my lecture notes for 450 after they’re presented so I assign time on Thursday and Friday to over the lecture notes.
 
I have now assigned blocks of time to all of my tasks but two, my 455 HW and my research work. 
<img />
 
I have 10 hours left to assign to both tasks. From my excel sheet, I know that I’ve only assigned about 3.5 hour to my research work. I assign every free block prior to my meeting to this paper. Notice how I did this last. Now I could have done it earlier on– this is a matter of preference. I like do this later on so that I can maximize my time on something like this while maintaining a structure for the week which I feel comfortable with and am familiar with. If I find that I don’t have enough time prior to the week once I assign my normal structure, I begin to move blocks around and create more free time for myself. This may lead me to do a reading after class or push work to the weekend. This is fine, but I like to ensure that I follow what I’m familiar and confident with first.
I end up assigning the block before and after 571 Response Design Lynda to my research work (block titled “ANN”) so I switch around the order of the first ANN block and 571 Response Design Lynda so that the two ANN blocks are side by side. Remember what I said earlier, it’s good to keep momentum. This brings up the amount of time I have to work on this paper to 10 hours. A bit excessive but that’s fine. I now assign he remaining free blocks to my last unchecked task 455 HW #2. This is my final schedule for the week
<img /></p>

<p>ADD SOMEWHERE:</p>

<p>When I sleep for 7+ hours, I have more will power and self control, my thoughts are more focused and more organized. </p>

<p>For pomodoro, I personally prefer 50 minute work blocks with 10 minutes breaks. Although, having the timer, I end up waiting for my next break so I end up feeling anxious for it. 
Also, some tasks, like coding, I need 20-30 minutes to get into the zone for. Once I’m in that zone I can work effectively for a few hours. Taking many breaks would break my momentum. For these, I take long break afterwards, say 20-40 minutes (usually 40). Pomodoro is great but don’t feel the need to force yourself to fit it if you don’t. And play with the time and number of short breaks before a long break so that it feels comfortable for you. </p>

<p>Try to exercise regularly. I try to go to the gym 3 times a week for intensity training and workout in my room for 10 minutes the rest of the days. I have more energy. </p>
